Getting back into basic web dev (after a few years of not touching it lolzmybad)

- HTML: totally forgot basic tag names. totally forgot how to link css and js files. almost forgot what a div was called.
- CSS: forgot most property names. fortunately the text editor gave me a quick assist. ayee. 
- JS: had to refreshen basically all syntax knowledge. had to break everything down to bits. how to get element. how to set innerHTML. how to change css property. then eventually got to creating functions again. created a few different functions to move two different clouds. once the goal was complete, code efficiency began and i cleaned up as much as i could within a time limit. 

Overall, this experience really stretched my mind. I didn't realize how far back I had to go and relearn everything. It's been a few years since I've touch web dev. Fortunately, it didn't take too long to remember and get back into things. Hopefully there will be more small projects like this to get me back to making things. Huzzahh. 11/24/18.
